Thread Factory that Logs Exceptions

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/VerboseThreads.html}<<<VerboseThreads>>>}}
  is an implementation of
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadFactory.html}<<<ThreadFactory>>>}}
  that instantiates threads that log all runtime exceptions through SLF4J.

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/VerboseThreads.html}<<<VerboseThreads>>>}}
  factory should be used together
  with executor services from <<<java.util.concurrent>>> package. Without
  this "verbose" thread factory your runnable tasks will not report anything to
  console once they die because of a runtime exception, for example:

+--
public class Main {
  public int main(String[] args) {
    Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2).scheduleAtFixedRate(
      new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
          // some sensitive operation that may throw
          // a runtime exception
        },
        1L, 1L, TimeUnit.SECONDS
      }
    );
  }
}
+--

  The exception in this example will never be caught by nobody. It will
  just terminate current execution of the <<<Runnable>>> task. Moreover,
  it won't reach any
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.html}<<<Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler>>>}},
  because this
  is how
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html}<<<ScheduledExecutorService>>>}}
  is behaving by default. This is how we solve
  the problem with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/VerboseThreads.html}<<<VerboseThreads>>>}}:

+--
public class Main {
  public int main(String[] args) {
    ThreadFactory factory = new VerboseThreads();
    Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2, factory).scheduleAtFixedRate(
      new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
          // the same sensitive operation that may throw
          // a runtime exception
        },
        1L, 1L, TimeUnit.SECONDS
      }
    );
  }
}
+--

  Now, every runtime exception that is not caught inside your
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html}<<<Runnable>>>}}
  will be reported to log (using
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/Logger.html}<<<Logger>>>}}).

  The only dependency you need is
  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jcabi/jcabi-log/${project.version}/jcabi-log-${project.version}.jar}<<<jcabi-log-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-log</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
+--
