Antlr3 Grammar Generator

  The profile is activated automatically when
  you have a <<<src/main/antlr3>>> directory.
  {{{http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/ANTLR+3+Wiki+Home}<<<org.antlr:antlr-runtime>>>}}
  dependency gets added to classpath
  and {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/antlr-maven-plugin/}<<<antlr3-maven-plugin>>>}}
  is executed in <<<generate-sources>>> phase.

  Don't forget to add the dependency explicitly
  to your list of dependencies into <<<runtime>>> scope
  (you don't need to specify <<<version>>> since it is already defined
  in parent <<<pom.xml>>>):

+--
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.antlr</groupId>
    <artifactId>antlr-runtime</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
+--
