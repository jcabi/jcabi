===============================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

    To build the project you need the following:

        - JDK 1.6
        - Maven (>= 3.0.3)


Continuous Integration Configuration
------------------------------------

    Continuous Integration platform has to be configured to run
    "mvn deploy" on every commit. Besides that the platform has to
    have "settings.xml", "pubring.gpg", and "secring.gpg" files available
    near the project source code base. These files are not inside SVN
    repository for security reasons. They have to be provided by the CI
    platform owner (the project owner, in most cases). "settings.xml"
    file has to document connection settings to the sonatype repository
    and web deployment platform. For example (this is a complete example
    of "setting.xml" file):

    <settings>
     <profiles>
      <profile>
       <id>ci</id>
       <properties>
        <gpg.homedir>../../closures/</gpg.homedir>
        <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
        <gpg.passphrase>....</gpg.passphrase>
       </properties>
      </profile>
     </profiles>
     <servers>
      <server>
       <id>jcabi.s3</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
      <server>
       <id>sonatype.nexus</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
     </servers>
    </settings>

    At the moment the following two goals are defined in our CI
    server:

    1) mvn clean deploy -e -Dci --settings ../../closures/settings.xml


How to release new version to Maven Central:
---------------------------------

    1. Create a new ticket in Trac, explaining why you want to release
       a new version (for example see ticket #9)

    2. Create new branch

    3. Replace <version jcabi="yes">...</version> with the next
       version you want to use, e.g.:

        find . -name "*.xml" -exec sed -i "" 's|\(\<version jcabi\=\"yes\"\>\)2\.0\-SNAPSHOT\(\<\/version\>\)|\11.0.1\2|g' {} \;

    4. Commit your changes to SVN

    5. Read these pages:
        https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-8.ReleaseIt
        http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/staging-sect-managing-plugin.html

    6. Run "mvn -Dci -Pjcabi clean deploy"

        Make sure that you have this profile in ~/.m2/settings.xml:

          <profile>
            <id>jcabi</id>
            <properties>
              <gpg.homedir>/code/gpg/jcabi</gpg.homedir>
              <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
              <gpg.passphrase>...</gpg.passphrase>
            </properties>
          </profile>

    7. Run "mvn nexus:staging-close"

    8. Run "mvn nexus:staging-promote" (target ID is "releases")

    9. Copy your branch to tags:

        svn cp ^/branches/ticketXX ^/tags/jcabi-X.X.X -m "refs #XX - jcabi-0.1.5 released to Maven Central"

    10. Delete the branch or merge it back to trunk (if you did any changes). Don't
        forget to revert back version number:

        find . -name "*.xml" -exec sed -i "" 's|\(\<version jcabi\=\"yes\"\>\)1\.0\.4\(\<\/version\>\)|\12.0-SNAPSHOT\2|g' {} \;

    11. Close the ticket as "fixed"

    That's it
