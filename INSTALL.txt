===============================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

    To build the project you need the following:

        - JDK 1.6
        - Maven (>= 3.0.3)


Continuous Integration Configuration
------------------------------------

    Continuous Integration platform has to be configured to run
    "mvn deploy" on every commit. Besides that the platform has to
    have "settings.xml", "pubring.gpg", and "secring.gpg" files available
    near the project source code base. These files are not inside SVN
    repository for security reasons. They have to be provided by the CI
    platform owner (the project owner, in most cases). "settings.xml"
    file has to document connection settings to the sonatype repository
    and web deployment platform. For example (this is a complete example
    of "setting.xml" file):

    <settings>
     <profiles>
      <profile>
       <id>ci</id>
       <properties>
        <gpg.homedir>../../closures/</gpg.homedir>
        <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
        <gpg.passphrase>....</gpg.passphrase>
       </properties>
      </profile>
     </profiles>
     <servers>
      <server>
       <id>www.jcabi.com</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
      <server>
       <id>oss.sonatype.org</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
     </servers>
    </settings>

    At the moment the following goal is defined in our CI server:

        mvn clean deploy -e -U -Pqulice --settings ../../closures/settings.xml


How to release new version to Maven Central:
---------------------------------
    https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide
    http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/staging-sect-managing-plugin.html
    https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/How+To+Generate+PGP+Signatures+With+Maven

    1. Create a new ticket in GitHub, explaining why you want to release
        a new version

    2. Create new branch, see https://github.com/yegor256/jcabi/issues/87
        for a live example

        git checkout -b 87

    3. Set the right version:

        mvn versions:set

        Change <version> manually in PARENT module

        Change jcabi.version property in PARENT module

        Change parent pom version in main pom.xml

        git commit -am '#87: version set to 0.5.4'

    4. Update versions:

        mvn versions:use-latest-versions
        git commit -am '#87: versions automatically updated'

    5. Explain this new release in changes/changes.xml release notes,
        and in README.md

    6. Deploy the product to Sonatype:

        rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/com/jcabi
        mvn -Pqulice -Psonatype -Pjcabi clean deploy

        Make sure that you have this profile in ~/.m2/settings.xml:

        <profile>
            <id>jcabi</id>
            <properties>
                <gpg.homedir>/code/gpg/jcabi</gpg.homedir>
                <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
                <gpg.passphrase>...</gpg.passphrase>
            </properties>
        </profile>

    7. Tag the branch

        git tag -a jcabi-0.5.4 -m '#87: version 0.1.2 released to Maven Central'
        git push origin jcabi-0.5.4

    8. Revert version back to SNAPSHOT:

        mvn versions:set
        change them manually in PARENT module
        git commit -am '#87: version back to SNAPSHOT'

    9. Merge the branch to 'master':

        git checkout master && git merge 87 && git push origin master && git branch -D 87

    10. In 4 hours, when the artifact is available in Maven Central,
        checkout the tag and deploy the site to Amazon S3:

            git checkout jcabi-0.5.4
            mvn -Psite clean install site-deploy

    11. Announce the release in Google Groups:
        https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/jcabi

    12. Announce the release in Twitter/Facebook/everywhere :)

    13. Close the issue as "fixed" in Github

    That's it
