Retrieving Maven Plugin Classpath in Runtime

  In a Maven plugin it is very often necessary to get a full
  classpath (determined by the project dependencies), in relation
  to a certain scope. For example, you want to get a full list
  of all JAR files available for the project in <<<test>>> scope.
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aether/Classpath.html}<<<Classpath>>>}}
  class helps to do this in one line:

+--
public class MyMojo extends AbstractMojo {
  /**
   * @parameter default-value="${project}"
   * @readonly
   */
  private MavenProject project;
  /**
   * @parameter default-value="${repositorySystemSession}"
   * @readonly
   */
  private RepositorySystemSession session;
  @Override
  public void execute() {
    Collection<File> jars = new Classpath(
      this.getProject(),
      this.session.getLocalRepository().getBasedir(),
      "test"
    );
  }
}
+--

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aether/Classpath.html}<<<Classpath>>>}}
  uses {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aether/Aether.html}<<<Aether>>>}}
  to collect required information and resolve all transitive dependencies. It
  also takes into account
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html}exclusions}}.
